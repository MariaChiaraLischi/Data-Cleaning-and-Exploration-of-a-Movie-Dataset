# Introduction to Computer Programming Project
This project was completed as part of the coursework for the course Introduction to Computer Programming during the Bachelorâ€™s degree program in Management and Computer Science at Luiss Guido Carli University.

This work is designed to load, clean, and save a refined version of the IMDB dataset. It supports specific queries, including identifying the highest-voted movie across the entire dataset and ranking the top 10 most prolific directors of the 20th century based on their number of directed films.

## Dataset Description
The dataset - a subset of the Internet Movie DataBase (IMDB) one - is split into three different .pkl files and contains information about movies, their cast/crew and their ratings.
Each file contains a different data structure, hereafter reported:
- title_basics contains some basic information about movies;
- title_ratings contains the IMDB user ratings;
- title_principals contains information about the movies main cast and crew.

## Objectives
The python script is useful to load and clean the aforementioned dataset, to save its cleaned version and to operate the following queries:
1) calculating the most voted movie across the entire IMDB dataset;
2) ranking the top-10 most prolific directors of the 20th century in terms of number of directed movies.
